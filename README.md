# Interface Design 2
**The Full Web Design Process**

ART 249 integrates the foundation level visual interface design skills introduced in ART 229 Interface Design I with the technical interface programming skills introduced in ART 128 Interface Programming I. Students go through the full creative design process for interaction design of analyzing, planning, designing, coding, testing, and launching a custom designed web standard compliant HTML/CSS static web site for a proposed client. Students document their findings through client documentation and defend their design decisions via presentations and critiques.

## Course Objectives & Competencies
Upon successful completion of ART 249, the student should be able to:
- Apply intermediate level and advanced concepts and principles of interface design and interface programming in the creation of client-based interactive applications.
- Utilize industry standard graphics editing software and web standard compliant markup and styling to create visually effective interactive client-based interfaces.
- Apply knowledge of the theory, history, and principles of interface design in the creation new media art.
- Apply successful problem-solving skills utilizing industry standard applications, technologies, and techniques in the creative and technical production process.
- Communicate effectively, both visually and verbally, by presenting work, defending design decisions, and by participating as an active critic during group critiques.
- Synthesize the concepts and principles of graphic design, interface design, and interface programming in the creation of interactive interfaces that integrate conceptual thinking, technical execution, and aesthetic application.


## Course Content
The general framework for this course is determined by the creative web design process for a singular web design project, consisting of defining, drafting, designing, and developing one web site over the course of the semester.

There are five phases to the course:

1. **The Definition Phase** (i.e. defining the project)
1. **The Drafting Phase** (i.e. drafting conceptual plans such as a site maps, wireframes, etc).
1. **The Design Phase** (i.e. designing the user interface (UI) via design mockups)
1. **The Development Phase** (i.e. coding the front-end of the site via HTML & CSS)
1. **The Due Diligence Phase** (i.e. testing the site to ensure quality assurance)


## Topics addressed & content
- The full creative process for web design
- Information Architecture (IA)
- User Experience Design (UX)
- User Interface Design (UID)
- Intermediate front-end web development (HTML, CSS, & JavaScript)


## Texts
There are no required texts for this course. Readings will be supplied by the instructor on a week to week basis, in either paper handout form or online.
Recommended, but not required texts:

- **Designing With Web Standards, 3rd Edition.**  
     by Jeffrey Zeldman and Ethan MArcotte.  
     New Riders, 2009, 9780321616951.

## Materials
All students are required to have hosting space to post their assignments, internship documentation, and ultimately their final presentation. Students are required to purchase a hosting plan with a third party hosting provider. Past students have purchased hosting plans from hosting providers such as Bluehost and GoDaddy (these are just a few of many hosting providers available). Plans should include ample disk space (ie. more than 2GB or unlimited), support for CGI, PHP, and MySQL, multiple
domain hosting (to host more than one site), one-click install/support for popular CMS options (Wordpress, Joomla, Drupal, etc), and a low, competitive price (an example rate is around $3-$5/month – this is subject to change based upon current trends for hosting prices). Additional materials may include an external hard drive or thumbnail drive with a minimum capacity of 4 GB.


## Instructor's Expectation
Attendance and online class participation are important to succeed in this course. It is essential that you attend both face-to-face class meetings, arrive promptly, and remain for the full duration of the scheduled class periods. Time outside of class and at your internship location is required in order to meet the requirements of the class. All assignments are due by posting them online by the specified due date/time as specified on course schedule.

Please use the Laulima's online discussion feature for general questions that may benefit others or that others can answer (instead of email), and Laulima's private messages feature, as necessary.


## Method of Instruction
The method of instruction will include individual feedback/instruction, lectures, demonstrations, class discussions, and critiques.


## Method of Evaluation & Grading Policy
The methods of evaluation used in this course are broken down as follows:
- **Projects & Assignments - 80%**
- **Class Participation - 20%**

Students will be expected to participate as active class members. This includes attending all classes; meeting all project deadlines; completing production time outside of class and in the lab environment; and participating as dependable team members. During critiques, all students are required to participate as both presenters and critics.

Grading is based on projects and class participation during critiques and online. It is the responsibility of the student to take notes, plan accordingly, and turn in completed assignments on the due dates. Missing a deadline will result in a point reduction equivalent to a full letter grade, unless there is a valid medical reason or a family emergency. Class Participation is calculated based upon a student's participation during critiques and online via Laulima in the discussion area. Projects may be revised and turned in again for re-grading.

Five major components of the class are worth 50-100 points each, with a total of 500 points for the course grade. The 500 Points for the final course grade can be broken down as follows:

- **Phase 1: Definition Phase** - 50 Points
  + Project Brief – *Due: Monday, August 31, 2015 11:59PM*
- **Phase 2: Draft Phase** - 50 Points
  + Conceptual Plans – *Due: Monday, September 07, 2015 11:59PM*
- **Phase 3: Design Phase** - 100 Points
  + Round 1 Designs (40 Points) – *Working Critique: Tuesday, September 22, 2015*
  + Round 2 Designs (30 Points) – *Working Critique: Tuesday, October 06, 2015*
  + Round 3 Designs (30 Points) – *Critique: Tuesday, October 20, 2015*
- **Phase 4: Development Phase** - 100 Points
  + Site Draft #1 (50 Points) – *Due: Tuesday, November 17, 2015*
  + Site Draft #2 (50 Points) – *Due: Tuesday, December 08, 2015*
- **Phase 5: Due Diligence & Final Project/Presentation** - 100 Points
  + Final Site + Portfolio Entry, posted on course web page – *Critique: Tuesday, December 15, 2015*
- **Class Participation** - 100 Points
  + Participation online via Laulima and at the critiques

Dividing the total 500 points by 5 will yield a more legible final course letter grade, dictated as follows:
- **A** (90–100)
- **B** (80–89)
- **C** (70–79)
- **D** (60–69)
- **F** (59–0)


## Special Student Services
If you are a student with a documented disability and have not voluntarily disclosed the nature of your disability so that we may coordinate the accommodations you need, you are invited to contact the Disability Support Services Office in Ilima 107, ph.734-9552, or email [kapdss@hawaii.edu](mailto:kapdss@hawaii.edu) for assistance.

## Student Conduct Code
A college campus is a community with specific behavior expectations designed to allow all students, faculty, and staff to flourish. Please familiarize yourself with KCC's Student Conduct Code in the course catalog. You should know your rights and responsibilities on campus. The Student Conduct Code describes specific campus policies related to: drug and alcohol use, smoking, lethal weapons, sexual harassment and sexual assault, academic honesty, nondiscrimination, and family privacy.

In all campus environments, Disruptive Behavior will not be tolerated. This means: any speech or action that **(1)** is disrespectful, offensive, and/or threatening; **(2)** interferes with the learning activities of other students; **(3)** impedes the delivery of college services; and/or **(4)** has a negative impact in any learning environment.
